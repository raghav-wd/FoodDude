A mini-startup, I invented when I came across a problem during my first year in my college hostel.
As I was used to being sleeping late at night, I always had to deal with the urge of eating snacks at night but our hostel didn't have any facility of canteen at night. So I took it upon me to run an experiment to start a wholesome business. The main idea was to develop a software to manage sales of the snacks.
